# Ursina-WaterShader

Just download any water height map and a corresponding normal map.
Modify lines 126 and 127 to load your textures and run the file!

The shader is not limited to the water entity provided and can be applied to any entity.

Its basically  a normal mapping+specular lighting shader. Its not at all limited to making water.
